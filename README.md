Programming languages evolve with time, reflecting the culture and communication styles of their users. This project aims to develop a lexical analyzer for a custom Gen Z-inspired programming language using Flex. The language incorporates Gen Z slangs and terminology as keywords, functions, and operators, making programming more engaging and relatable to younger developers. The lexical analyzer will efficiently tokenize input code, ensuring syntactic correctness and preparing it for further stages of compilation.
