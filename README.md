# 🕶️ Zigma - A Gen Z Inspired Programming Language

**GenZLang** is a fun and modern twist on programming language design, integrating Gen Z slang to make coding more relatable and engaging for younger developers. Built using **Flex**, this project focuses on the development of a **lexical analyzer** that tokenizes Gen Z-styled code into syntactically correct tokens for further compilation stages.

---

## 🧠 Project Objective

To develop a **lexical analyzer** for a custom Gen Z-inspired programming language using **Flex**, replacing traditional keywords and operators with Gen Z terms and cultural references.

---

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Recognizes **Gen Z slang** as language keywords, functions, and operators  
- ✅ Supports **arithmetic, relational, logical, and assignment** operators  
- ✅ Handles **identifiers**, **numbers**, **strings**, and **comments**  
- ✅ Detects **library includes**  
- ✅ Allows for **dynamic function detection**

```

#### Arithmetic:
```
+, -, *, /, %, ++, --
```

#### Assignment:

- Floats: `123.456`
- Negatives: `-10`

---

### 🧑‍💻 **Identifiers**
- Variable/Function names like:
  ```
  glowUp, drip_level
  ```

---

### 📞 **Functions**
| GenZLang | Meaning        |
|----------|----------------|
| `yapp()` | `print()`      |
| `yoink()` | `scanf()`      |
| `master_chief()` | `main()`      |
| Any identifier followed by `(` is recognized as a function |

---

### 💬 **Strings**
```
"fortnite", "big justice!"
```

---

### 🗣️ **Comments**

- Single-line:
  ```c
  // This is a comment
  ```

- Multi-line:
  ```c
  /* This is a multi-line comment */
  ```

---

### 📚 **Library Includes**
```c
#include <zoomer.h>
```

---

## 🔧 Built With

- **Flex (Fast Lexical Analyzer Generator)**
- Gen Z cultural references ✨

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

Coming soon — setup instructions, example code, and how to compile using `flex` and `gcc`.

---

## 🤘 Sample Code (Coming Soon)

```c
#include <zoomer.h>

master_chief() {
    drip_level = 100;
    yapp("Rizz mode activated!");
}
```
